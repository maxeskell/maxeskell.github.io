description: This website was my final project.  I used angularJS front end, and ruby/rails backed end with a Postgresql database.  The app allows a companies employees to share their ideas.  Other employees can 'love' ideas or form a team to help turn the idea into reality.  By surfacing ideas as widely as possible, and building a community around the ideas, there is a great chance that these ideas will become reality.
