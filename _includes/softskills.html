                    <p class="text-muted">I have spent the last fifteen years learning about leadership.  From leading small teams of friends climbing mountains around the world, through leading soldiers on the battlefield, to building and leading teams at McKinsey I have matched practical application with academic study.  For me, leadership is simply helping others succeed.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Team and businesses need people who get things done.  I spent over a decade in the military during strategic direction into action.  The key to execution is having a clear understanding of what is needed, creating a plan and then adapting where necessary.</p>
