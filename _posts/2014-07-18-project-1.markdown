description: I developed this game to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript.  I chose a simple wack-a-mole type game so that my 2-year old daughter could play it.  With the basic game constructed, I focused on capturing data from the user actions, to give the user feedback on how they were doing and to create competition between players.
