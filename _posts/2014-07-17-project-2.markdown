description: I built this website as I was frustrated that there was no single place where I could see what wildlife surrounded me.  I love walking with my family, and like showing my daughter different wildlife.  I create this app, to showcase a simple JS/MongoDB which allows people to record wildlife near them.  People who register can upload images and record where they took them and what they saw.  I have also incorporated Google Vision, which automatically scans each image and tells the user what is in the image.
